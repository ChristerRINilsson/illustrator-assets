2. Test your templates first, use the [Illustrator plugin](https://github.com/AMEA-AB/amea-cep-plugin) to populate data and validate flags.
3. If you are unsure about your changes or want to test the entire flow, you can create a separate branch and then enter the branch in the settings for the [Illustrator plugin](https://github.com/AMEA-AB/amea-cep-plugin).
4.
